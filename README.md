### Proposed Module Structure
The following module structure is proposed but not mandatory for a module. We try to keep 'em all the same for recognition.
```
<module-name>/
|   assets/
    |   css/
    |   images/
    |   scripts/
|   classes/
    |   components/
    |   collections/
    |   externals/
    |   views/
|   templates/
    |   cache/
|   module.php
```
